## NICE-TO-HAVE GAPS (Lower Priority)

### 10. Tummy Time (Maveliggetid)

While SIDS prevention emphasizes back sleeping, tummy time while **awake and supervised** is important for motor development. Specific Danish recommendations not found in current search but commonly recommended for:
- Preventing flat head (plagiocephaly)
- Strengthening neck and shoulder muscles
- Preparing for crawling

---

### 11. Teething (Tandfrembrud)

Partially covered in 07-health-checkups.md (mentioned as discussion topic at 5 months), but could use dedicated section:
- First teeth typically 6-10 months
- Symptoms (drooling, irritability)
- Relief methods
- Dental care from first tooth

---

### 12. Bathing Guidelines

Not covered in research:
- Frequency recommendations
- Water temperature
- Safety considerations
- Umbilical cord considerations (before it falls off)

---

### 13. Screen Time Recommendations

Not found in Danish sources searched, but increasingly relevant for modern parents. WHO recommends no screen time for children under 2 years.

**Priority:** Low
**Source Available:** [sundhed.dk - Barnets første tænder](https://www.sundhed.dk/borger/patienthaandbogen/boern/om-boern/boerns-udvikling/barnets-foerste-taender/)

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| First teeth | 6-8 months (range: 6-12 months) |
| Symptoms | Drooling, red gums, irritability, biting |
| Fever | Tandfrembrud does NOT cause fever >38°C |
| Relief | Bidering (teething ring), cold objects |

#### 3. Bathing Guidelines (Badning)
**Priority:** Low
**Source Status:** No official sundhed.dk/Sundhedsstyrelsen source found

Available from educational sources only:
